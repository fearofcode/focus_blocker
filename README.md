focus_blocker
=============

This is an extremely simple Chrome extension that lets you block domains in Chrome. While there are many existing Chrome extensions that do this, most or all of them seem to sell your browsing data. This one does not.

How to install
--------------

- Open Chrome Extensions: Type chrome://extensions in your address bar.
- Enable Developer Mode: Toggle the switch in the top-right corner.
- Load Unpacked: Click the "Load unpacked" button in the top-left.
- Select Folder: Choose the folder you created.

To access the UI, the easiest way to do it is to click the Extensions button in the address bar, select the extension, then click the "S" icon that shows up. There you can add domains and remove any ones you want access to by clicking the "X" button next to the domain name.

Status and limitations
----------------------

This seems to work but it is extremely simple. It does not generate a custom page for blocked pages like other extensions, you just get a generic Chrome error page saying `This page has been blocked by an extension. Try disabling your extensions. ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT`.

This code was generated by an LLM since I just wanted something quick. There may be bugs. At least I won't sell your data to ad company.
